INSTALL for Taint.pm

For most systems, the usual routine will work. First unpack the
distribution, then cd into the new directory and issue these
commands.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If your system doesn't have MakeMaker support, you may need to
manually run the tests and then install. But, if you don't have
MakeMaker, you should be used to that by now.

INSTALLER'S OPTION

If you wish to disable the allegedly-useful but potentially
easy-to-abuse unconditional_untaint function, you may do that before
you install this module. Use this command to make the makefile:

    perl Makefile.PL ALLOW_UU=0

If, on the other hand, you've disabled the function and now you've
decided to relent, use this command to re-enable it:

    perl Makefile.PL ALLOW_UU=1

After either of those commands, use the same make sequence as above.
(Alternatively, you might manually edit Taint.pm, before or after
installing, but doing that shows that you're lacking Laziness, or
at least Impatience.)
