                           Taint.pm
		Tom Phoenix <rootbeer@teleport.com>

Perl has the ability to mark data as 'tainted', as described
in the perlsec(1) manpage. Perl will prevent tainted data
from being used for some operations, and you may wish to add
such caution to your own code. The routines in this module
provide convenient ways to taint data and to check data for
taint.

SYNOPSIS
       use Taint;
       warn "Oops"
         if tainted $foo, @bar;      # Test for tainted data
       kill $foo, @bar;              # before using it

       use Taint qw(taint);
       taint @some_vars;             # Intentionally taint data

REQUIRES
    This should work with any Perl system which can use MakeMaker
    (that is, I believe at least Unix, Win32, VMS), and it should
    be easy (if not trivial) to port to other Perl systems. It uses
    no C code.

    Please don't rely upon an old version of this module.

SPECIAL NOTE
    There is a different Taint module available in the 
    CPAN directory for Dan Sugalski. Please compare and
    contrast these modules' approaches so that we may all
    reach a consensus about how this module should act.
